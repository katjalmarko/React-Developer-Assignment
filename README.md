Create a web application for ToDo lists in the React framework.

Required functionality:
Creating a ToDo list (there can be more than one)
  
ToDo list contains:
- Name
- ToDo items
- Adding a ToDo item to the list
  
ToDo item contains:
- Caption
- Free text
- Deadline (date and time)
- Deleting a ToDo item
- Marking the ToDo as completed
- Filter items (all, active, completed)
- Search for ToDo items within the list
- Persistence of ToDo lists using an external API (e.g. mockapi.io)

The solution should demonstrate the capabilities to work with (the more the better):
- TypeScript language
- Advanced React constructs (hooks, functional components, data management)
- Advanced EcmaScript and TypeScript constructs
- ReactRouter
- Redux (ideally in combination with saga, axios)
- MaterialUI (v5 ideally in combination with styled components, at worst SCSS, not CSS)
- Validated forms (formik, useFormHook in combination with joi, yup)
- Reasonable structuring of application source code

We leave the subpages and layout of the app up to you,
When coding, focus mainly on code cleanliness and using the right patterns, styles, functions and language principles.
